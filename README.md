# nand2tetris-solutions
my solutions to the nand2tetris course, no cheating please!!!!

nand2tetris is a very cool course built principally by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, in which students learn to build a computer all the way from logic gates to CPU to OS to a simple game. As I go, I'm posting my solutions to the coursework here in the laughable hope that someone will see them and engage me in a fruitful dialog on circuit design.
